# SAMAddressBar

Clone of Safari's address bar from long ago.

SAMAddressBar is tested on iOS 6 and requires ARC. Released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

Open up the included Xcode project for an example app. The example app uses CocoaPods for its dependency on [SAMWebView](https://github.com/soffes/SAMWebView). SAMAddressBar doesn't have to be used with SAMWebView. This is just for the example app.

## Installation

Simply add the files in the files in the `SAMAddressBar` folder to your project or add `SAMAddressBar` to your Podfile if you're using CocoaPods.
